## **About Us**

We are **Collectionless AI**, a research and development group based in Siena. Our vision for Artificial Intelligence is founded on three core pillars:

* 🔒 **Privacy-centric**: We design systems that respect user data and privacy from the ground up.
* 💡 **Low Energy Consumption**: We aim for sustainable AI by reducing computational and energy footprints.
* 🌐 **Decentralization**: We believe in a future where intelligence is not concentrated on a few central servers but is distributed across a peer-to-peer network.

Our flagship project that embodies this vision is **UNaIVERSE**.
